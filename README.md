The project is on predicting the ratings of BoardGameGeek Reviews
The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews.

The dataset contains three separate CSV files.

The first CSV file named 20119-05-02 has all the ranking data, bgg_13m_reviews CSV file has all reviews stored in it, and games_details_info has the specific details about the data. 

The goal of the project is to predict the rating of the review, and the main thing that should be highlighted is the kind of improvement done over the given available codes and tutorials online.

As per my progress, I a beginner in Data Analysis and using Python programming so clearly I preferred first to explore the complete dataset using various libraries and inbuilt functions provided by python packages.

In the dataset, all categories have unique ranks for each game, except the leading board game ranking.

The majority of the 15 categories only have one board game, except abstract, children, customizable, family, party, strategy, thematic, and war.

All numerical variables excluding categories have no null values.

I have performed analysis and could view the datatypes, shape of the data, the complete description like the Mean of the required columns.

A heatmap which was looking quite attractive which can be a best diagramatic description of the data present in games_details_info.csv file.

The maximum number of board games published during a given duration was also helpful for us to know aboutthe year in which there were a lot of games published.
